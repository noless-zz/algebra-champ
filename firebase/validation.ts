/**
 * Validates user login credentials against Firebase Auth.
 * This is intended for manual testing and validation during development.
 * It will sign the user in and immediately sign them out.
 * 
 * To use, you can import this function and call it from a temporary
 * location, for example, within a useEffect hook in App.jsx:
 * 
 * useEffect(() => {
 *   validateUserLogin("no.less@live.com", "nn2008");
 * }, []);
 * 
 * @param {string} email The user's email.
 * @param {string} password The user's password.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to an object indicating success or failure.
